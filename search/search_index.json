Data sets automatically analyzed, annotated, and organized online Machine learning pipelines automatically shared from many libraries. Extensive APIs to integrate OpenML into your own tools and scripts Reproducible results (e.g. models, evaluations) for easy comparison and reuse Collaborate in real time, right from your existing tools Make your work more visible, reusable, and easily citable Open source tools to automate experimentation and model building Concepts \u00b6 OpenML operates on a number of core concepts which are important to understand: Datasets Datasets are pretty straight-forward. They simply consist of a number of rows, also called instances , usually in tabular form. Example: The iris dataset Tasks A task consists of a dataset, together with a machine learning task to perform, such as classification or clustering and an evaluation method. For supervised tasks, this also specifies the target column in the data. Example: Classifying different iris species from other attributes and evaluate using 10-fold cross-validation. Flows A flow identifies a particular machine learning algorithm from a particular library or framework such as Weka, mlr or scikit-learn. It should at least contain a name, details about the workbench and its version and a list of settable hyperparameters. Ideally, the appropriate workbench can deserialize it again (the algorithm, not the model). Example: WEKA's RandomForest Runs A run is a particular flow, that is algorithm, with a particular parameter setting, applied to a particular task. Example: Classifying irises with WEKA's RandomForest How to add instances of Data, Flows, Tasks and Runs is defined in the OpenML definition . Data \u00b6 You can upload and download datasets through the website , or APIs . Data hosted elsewhere can be referenced by URL. Data consists of columns, also known as features or covariates, each of which is either numeric, nominal or a string, and has a unique name. A column can also contain any number of missing values. Most datasets have a \"default target attribute\" which denotes the column that is usually the target, also known as dependent variable, in supervised learning tasks. The default target column is denoted by \"(target)\" in the web interface. Not all datasets have such a column, though, and a supervised task can pick any column as the target (as long as it is of the appropriate type). Example: The default target variable for the MNIST data is to predict the class from pixel values, OpenML also allows you to create a task that tries to predict the value of pixel257 given all the other pixel values and the class column. As such, the class is also considered a feature in OpenML terminology. OpenML automatically analyzes the data, checks for problems, visualizes it, and computes data characteristics , also called data qualities (including simple ones like number of features, but also more complex statistics like kurtosis or the AUC of a decision tree of depth 3). These data qualities can be useful to find and compare datasets. Every dataset gets a dedicated page with all known information (check out zoo ), including a wiki, visualizations, statistics, user discussions, and the tasks in which it is used. Info OpenML currently only supports uploading of ARFF files. We aim to extend this in the near future, and allow conversions between the main data types. Dataset ID and versions \u00b6 A dataset can be uniquely identified by its dataset ID, which you can find in the URL of the dataset page, such as 62 for zoo . Each dataset also has a name, but several dataset can have the same name. When several datasets have the same name, they are called \"versions\" of the same dataset (although that is not necessarily true). The version number is assigned according to the order of upload. Different versions of a dataset can be accessed through the drop down menu at the top right of the dataset page. Dataset status \u00b6 Each dataset has a status, which can be \"active\", \"deactivated\" or \"in_preparation\". When you upload a dataset, it will be marked \"in_preparation\" until it is approved by a site administrator. Once it is approved, the dataset will become \"active\". If a severe issue has been found with a dataset, it can become \"deactivated\". By default, the search will only display datasets that are \"active\", but you can access and download datasets with any status. Ignored features \u00b6 Features in datasets can be tagged as \"ignored\" or \"row id\". Those features will not be considered by programming interfaces, and excluded from any tasks. Tasks \u00b6 Tasks describe what to do with the data. OpenML covers several task types , such as classification and clustering. You can create tasks online. Tasks are little containers including the data and other information such as train/test splits, and define what needs to be returned. Tasks are machine-readable so that machine learning environments know what to do, and you can focus on finding the best algorithm. You can run algorithms on your own machine(s) and upload the results. OpenML evaluates and organizes all solutions online. Tasks are real-time, collaborative data mining challenges (e.g. see this one ): you can study, discuss and learn from all submissions (code has to be shared), while OpenML keeps track of who was first. More concretely, tasks specify the dataset, the kind of machine learning task (i.e. regression), the target attribute (i.e. which column in the dataset should be predicted), the number of splits for cross-validated evaluation and the exact dataset splits, as well as an optional evaluation metric (i.e. mean squared error). Given this specification, a task can be solved using any of the integrated machine learning tools, like Weka, mlr and scikit-learn. Note You can also supply hidden test sets for the evaluation of solutions. Novel ways of ranking solutions will be added in the near future. Flows \u00b6 Flows are algorithms, workflows, or scripts solving tasks. You can upload them through the website , or APIs . Code hosted elsewhere (e.g., GitHub) can be referenced by URL, though typically they are generated automatically by machine learning environments. Flows contain all the information necessary to apply a particular workflow or algorithm to a new task. Usually a flow is specific to a task-type, i.e. you can not run a classification model on a clustering task. Every flow gets a dedicated page with all known information (check out WEKA's RandomForest ), including a wiki, hyperparameters, evaluations on all tasks, and user discussions. Note Each flow specifies requirements and dependencies, and you need to install these locally to execute a flow on a specific task. We aim to add support for VMs so that flows can be easily (re)run in any environment. Runs \u00b6 Runs are applications of flows to a specific task. They are typically submitted automatically by machine learning environments (through the OpenML APIs ), with the goal of creating a reproducible experiment (though exactly reproducing experiments across machines might not be possible because of changes in numeric libraries and operating systems). OpenML organizes all runs online, linked to the underlying data, flows, parameter settings, people, and other details. OpenML also independently evaluates the results contained in the run given the provided predictions. You can search and compare everyone's runs online, download all results into your favorite machine learning environment, and relate evaluations to known properties of the data and algorithms. OpenML stores and analyzes results in fine detail, up to the level of individual instances. !!! Want to read more? A more detailed description can be found in this blogpost . Authentication \u00b6 You can download and inspect all datasets, tasks, flows and runs through the website or the API without creating an account. However, if you want to upload datasets or experiments, you need to create an account or sign in and create an API key . This key can then be used with any of the OpenML APIs . Integrations \u00b6 OpenML is deeply integrated in several popular machine learning environments. Given a task, these integrations will automatically download the data into the environments, allow you to run any algorithm/flow, and automatically upload all runs. Programming APIs \u00b6 If you want to integrate OpenML into your own tools, we offer several Language-specific APIs , so you can easily interact with OpenML to list, download and upload datasets, tasks, flows and runs. With these APIs you can download a task, run an algorithm, and upload the results in just a few lines of code. OpenML also offers a REST API which allows you to talk to OpenML directly. Tags \u00b6 Datasets, tasks, runs and flows can be assigned tags, either via the web interface or the API. These tags can be used to search and annotated datasets. For example the tag OpenML100 refers to benchmark machine learning algorithms used as a benchmark suite. Anyone can add or remove tags on any entity. Studies (under construction) \u00b6 You can combine datasets, flows and runs into studies, to collaborate with others online, or simply keep a log of your work. Each project gets its own page, which can be linked to publications so that others can find all the details online. To link data sets, task, flows or runs to a certain study, you can use tags. By adding the tag \"study_XYZ\" the object will automatically be linked and appear on the page of study XYZ (with XYZ being the study id, which can e.g. be found in the URL of the study). Circles (under construction) \u00b6 You can create circles of trusted researchers in which data can be shared that is not yet ready for publication.","title":"Get started"},{"location":"#concepts","text":"OpenML operates on a number of core concepts which are important to understand: Datasets Datasets are pretty straight-forward.

IMPORTANT: Most authentication operations are handled by the ION_Auth library ( http://benedmunds.com/ion_auth/ ). DO NOT alter information directly in the user table, always use the ION_Auth API. A user can be part of one or many groups. The following user groups exists: 1. Admin Group: With great power comes great responsibility. Admin users can overrule all security checks on the server, i.e., delete a dataset or run that is not theirs, or even delete a flow that contains runs. 2. Normal Group: Level that is required for read/write interaction with the server. Almost all users are part of this group. 3. Read-only Group: Level that can be used for read interaction with the server.

Also XML examples are provided, e.g., https://www.openml.org/api/v1/xml_example/data . The XSD schema's are exactly the same as used on the server. Whenever an upload fails and the server mentions an XML/XSD verification error, please run the uploaded xml against one of the provided XSD schema's, for example on this webtool: http://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html In order to maintain one XSD schema for both uploading and downloading stuff, the XSD sometimes contains more fields than seem necessary from the offset. Usually, the additional fields that are indicated as such in the comments (for example, in the upload dataset xsd this are the id, upload_date, etc fields). The XSD's maintain basically three consistencies functions: * Ensure that the correct fields are uploaded * Ensure that the fields contain the correct data types. * Ensure that the fields do not contain to much characters for the database to upload. For the latter two, it is important to note that the XSD seldom accept default string content (i.e., xs:string). Rather, we use self defined data types, that use regular expressions to ensure the right content.

Various high level papers have been published that overview the design goals, benefits and opportunities (for example, at ECML/PKDD 2013 , SIGKDD Explorations and JMLR ). However, there is no clear overview of the basic concepts upon which the platform is build. In this blog post I will review these, and discuss some best practices. This page is a slightly updated version of this blogpost Data \u00b6 One of the core components of OpenML are datasets. People can upload their datasets, and the system automatically organises these on line. An example of a dataset is the well-known Iris dataset . It shows all features, once of these is identified as the 'default target attribute', although this concept is flexible. It also shows some automatically computed data qualities (or, meta-features). Each dataset has its own unique ID. Information about the dataset, the data features and the data qualities can be obtained automatically by means of the following API functions: Get all available datasets Get dataset (required the data id) Get data features (requires the data id) Get data qualities (requires the data id) Task types and tasks \u00b6 A dataset alone does not constitute a scientific task. We must first agree on what types of results are expected to be shared. This is expressed in task types: they define what types of inputs are given, which types of output are expected to be returned, and what protocols should be used. For instance, classification tasks should include well-defined cross-validation procedures, labelled input data, and require predictions as outputs. The collection of all this information together is called a task. The Iris dataset has various tasks defined on it, for example this one . Although the web-interface does not show it, this task formally describes the target attribute that should be modelled (in this case the same as the default target attribute of the dataset, but this is flexible), the quality estimation procedure (10-fold cross-validation), the evaluation measure (predictive accuracy) and the cross-validation folds. Useful API operations include: Get all available tasks Get all available tasks of a given type (e.g. get all Classification tasks, requires the id of the task type) Get the details of a task (requires task id) Currently, there are a wide range of task types defined on OpenML, including classification, regression, on line learning, clustering and subgroup discovery. Although this set can be extended, this is currently not a supported API operation (meaning that we will add them by hand). If you interested in task types that are currently not supported, please contact us. Flows \u00b6 Tasks can be 'solved' by classifiers (or algorithms, workflows, flows). OpenML stores references to these flows. It is important to stress that flows are actually ran on the computer of the user, only meta-information about the flow is stored on OpenML. This information includes basic trivialities such as the creator, toolbox and compilation instructions, but also more formal description about hyper parameter. A flow can also contain subflows, for example, the flow Bagging can have a subflow 'Decision Tree' which would make the flow 'Bagging of Decision Trees'. A flow is distinguished by its name and 'external version', which are both provided by the uploader. When uploading a flow, it is important to think about a good naming convention for the both, for example, the git commit number could be used as external version, as this uniquely identifies a state of the code. Ideally, when two persons are using the same flow, they will use the same name and external version, so that results of the flows can be compared across tasks. (This is ensured when using the toolboxed in which OpenML is integrated, such as Weka, Scikit Learn and MLR). Useful API functions are: List all flows List all my flows Give details about a given flow (requires flow id) Runs \u00b6 Whenever a flow executes a task, this is called a run. The existence of runs is actually the main contribution of OpenML. Some experiments take weeks to complete, and having the results stored on OpenML helps other researchers reuse the experiments. The task description specifies which information should be uploaded in order to have a valid run, in most cases, for each cross-validation fold the predictions on the test set. This allows OpenML to calculate basic evaluation measures, such as predictive accuracy, ROC curves and many more. Also information about the flow and hyper parameter settings should be provided. Some useful API functions: List all runs performed on a given task (requires task id, e.g., the iris task is 59) Compare two flows on all tasks (requires a comma separated list of flow ids, e.g., 1720, 1721 for comparing k-nn with a decision tree) And many more ... Usually, the result is in some XML or JSON format (depending on the preference of the user), linking together various task ids, flow ids, etc. In order for this to become meaningful, the user needs to perform other API tasks to get information about what flows were executed, what tasks and datasets were used, etc. Details about this will be provided in another post. Setups \u00b6 Every run that is executed by a flow, contains information about the hyper parameter settings of the flow. A setup is the combination of all parameter settings of a given flow. OpenML internally links the result of a given run to a setup id. This way, experiments can be done across hyper parameter settings. For example, Compare two setups on all tasks (requires a comma separated list of setup ids, e.g., 8994, 8995, 8996 for comparing multiple MLP configurations) As setups constitute a complex concept, most of the operations concerning setups are hidden from the user. Hence, not all setup functions are properly documented yet.

Various high level papers have been published that overview the design goals, benefits and opportunities (for example, at ECML/PKDD 2013 , SIGKDD Explorations and JMLR ). However, there is no clear overview of the basic concepts upon which the platform is build. In this blog post I will review these, and discuss some best practices. This page is a slightly updated version of this blogpost","title":"Basic Concepts"},{"location":"Basic-Concepts/#data","text":"One of the core components of OpenML are datasets. People can upload their datasets, and the system automatically organises these on line. An example of a dataset is the well-known Iris dataset . It shows all features, once of these is identified as the 'default target attribute', although this concept is flexible. It also shows some automatically computed data qualities (or, meta-features). Each dataset has its own unique ID. Information about the dataset, the data features and the data qualities can be obtained automatically by means of the following API functions: Get all available datasets Get dataset (required the data id) Get data features (requires the data id) Get data qualities (requires the data id)","title":"Data"},{"location":"Basic-Concepts/#task-types-and-tasks","text":"A dataset alone does not constitute a scientific task. We must first agree on what types of results are expected to be shared. This is expressed in task types: they define what types of inputs are given, which types of output are expected to be returned, and what protocols should be used. For instance, classification tasks should include well-defined cross-validation procedures, labelled input data, and require predictions as outputs. The collection of all this information together is called a task. The Iris dataset has various tasks defined on it, for example this one . Although the web-interface does not show it, this task formally describes the target attribute that should be modelled (in this case the same as the default target attribute of the dataset, but this is flexible), the quality estimation procedure (10-fold cross-validation), the evaluation measure (predictive accuracy) and the cross-validation folds. Useful API operations include: Get all available tasks Get all available tasks of a given type (e.g. get all Classification tasks, requires the id of the task type) Get the details of a task (requires task id) Currently, there are a wide range of task types defined on OpenML, including classification, regression, on line learning, clustering and subgroup discovery. Although this set can be extended, this is currently not a supported API operation (meaning that we will add them by hand). If you interested in task types that are currently not supported, please contact us.","title":"Task types and\u00a0tasks"},{"location":"Basic-Concepts/#flows","text":"Tasks can be 'solved' by classifiers (or algorithms, workflows, flows). OpenML stores references to these flows. It is important to stress that flows are actually ran on the computer of the user, only meta-information about the flow is stored on OpenML. This information includes basic trivialities such as the creator, toolbox and compilation instructions, but also more formal description about hyper parameter. A flow can also contain subflows, for example, the flow Bagging can have a subflow 'Decision Tree' which would make the flow 'Bagging of Decision Trees'. A flow is distinguished by its name and 'external version', which are both provided by the uploader. When uploading a flow, it is important to think about a good naming convention for the both, for example, the git commit number could be used as external version, as this uniquely identifies a state of the code. Ideally, when two persons are using the same flow, they will use the same name and external version, so that results of the flows can be compared across tasks. (This is ensured when using the toolboxed in which OpenML is integrated, such as Weka, Scikit Learn and MLR). Useful API functions are: List all flows List all my flows Give details about a given flow (requires flow id)","title":"Flows"},{"location":"Basic-Concepts/#runs","text":"Whenever a flow executes a task, this is called a run. The existence of runs is actually the main contribution of OpenML. Some experiments take weeks to complete, and having the results stored on OpenML helps other researchers reuse the experiments. The task description specifies which information should be uploaded in order to have a valid run, in most cases, for each cross-validation fold the predictions on the test set. This allows OpenML to calculate basic evaluation measures, such as predictive accuracy, ROC curves and many more. Also information about the flow and hyper parameter settings should be provided. Some useful API functions: List all runs performed on a given task (requires task id, e.g., the iris task is 59) Compare two flows on all tasks (requires a comma separated list of flow ids, e.g., 1720, 1721 for comparing k-nn with a decision tree) And many more ... Usually, the result is in some XML or JSON format (depending on the preference of the user), linking together various task ids, flow ids, etc. In order for this to become meaningful, the user needs to perform other API tasks to get information about what flows were executed, what tasks and datasets were used, etc. Details about this will be provided in another post.","title":"Runs"},{"location":"Basic-Concepts/#setups","text":"Every run that is executed by a flow, contains information about the hyper parameter settings of the flow. A setup is the combination of all parameter settings of a given flow. OpenML internally links the result of a given run to a setup id. This way, experiments can be done across hyper parameter settings. For example, Compare two setups on all tasks (requires a comma separated list of setup ids, e.g., 8994, 8995, 8996 for comparing multiple MLP configurations) As setups constitute a complex concept, most of the operations concerning setups are hidden from the user.

our web framework. It handles user authentication, dataset upload, task creation, and other aspects that require server-side interaction. It is designed to be independent from the OpenML API. This means that you can use it to create your own personal frontend for OpenML, using the main OpenML server to provide the data. Of course, you can also link it to your own local OpenML setup . Design \u00b6 Out flask app follows Application factories design pattern . A new app instance can be created by: from autoapp import create_app app = create_app ( config_object ) The backend is designed in a modular fashion with flask Blueprints . Currently the flask app consist of two blueprints public and user: * Public blueprint: contains routes which do not require user authentication or authorization. like signup and forgot password. * User blueprint: Contains routes which require user authentication like login, changes in profile and fetching API key. New blueprints can be registered in server/app.py with register_blueprints function: def register_blueprints ( app ): app . register_blueprint ( new_blueprint ) Security \u00b6 Flask backend uses JSON web tokens for all the user handling tasks. Flask JWT extended library is used to bind JWT with flask app. Current Mechanism: 1. User logs in. 2. JWT token is assigned to user and sent with every request to frontend. 3. All the user information can only be accessed with a JWT token like edit profile and API-key. 4. The JWT token is stored in local memory of the browser. 5. The token get expired after 2 hours or get blacklisted after logout. JWT is registered as an extension in extension.py All the user password hash are saved in Argon2 format with the new backend. Registering Extensions \u00b6 To register a new extension to flask backend extension has to be added in server/extensions.py and initialised in server/app.py. Current extensions are : flask_argon2, flask_bcrypt, flask_jwt_extended and flask_sqlalchemy. Configuring App \u00b6 Configuration variables like secret keys, Database URI and extension configurations are specified in server/config.py with Config object, which is supplied to flask app during creation. Bindings to OpenML server \u00b6 You can specify which OpenML server to connect to. This is stored in the .env file in the main directory. It is set to the main OpenML server by default: ELASTICSEARCH_SERVER = https : // www . openml . org / es OPENML_SERVER = https : // www . openml . org The ElasticSearch server is used to download information about datasets, tasks, flows and runs, as well as to power the frontend search. The OpenML server is used for uploading datasets, tasks, and anything else that requires calls to the OpenML API. Bindings to frontend \u00b6 The frontend is generated by React . See below for more information. The React app is loaded as a static website. This is done in Flask setup in file server.py . app = Flask ( __name__ , static_url_path = '' , static_folder = 'src/client/app/build' ) It will find the React app there and load it.","title":"Flask backend"},{"location":"Flask/#design","text":"Out flask app follows Application factories design pattern .

It is invoked from the OpenML API by means of a CLI interface. Typically, a call looks like this: java -jar webapplication.jar -config \"api_key=S3CR3T_AP1_K3Y\" -f evaluate_run -r 500 Which in this case executes the webapplication jar, invokes the function \"evaluate run\" and gives it parameter run id 500. The config parameter can be used to set some config items, in this case the api_key is mandatory. Every OpenML user has an api_key, which can be downloaded from their OpenML profile page . The response of this function is a call to the OpenML API uploading evaluation results to the OpenML database. Note that in this case the PHP website invokes the Java webapplication, which makes a call to the PHP website again, albeit another endpoint. The webapplication does not have direct writing rights into the database. All communication to the database goes by means of the OpenML Connector , which communicates with the OpenML API. As a consequence, the webapplication could run on any system, i.e., there is no formal need for the webapplication to be on the same server as the website code. This is important, since this created modularity, and not all servers provide a command line interface to PHP scripts. Another example is the following: java -jar webapplication -config \"api_key=S3CR3T_AP1_K3Y\" -f all_wrong -r 81,161 -t 59 Which takes a comma separated list of run ids (no spaces) and a task id as input and outputs the test examples on the dataset on which all algorithms used in the runs produced wrong examples (in this case, weka.BayesNet_K2 and weka.SMO, respectively). An error will be displayed if there are runs not consistent with the task id in there. Extending the Java App \u00b6 The bootstrap class of the webapplication is org.openml.webapplication.Main It automatically checks authentication settings (such as api_key) and the determines which function to invoke. It uses a switch-like if - else contruction to facilitate the functionalities of the various functions. Additional functions can be added to this freely. From there on, it is easy to add functionality to the webapplication. Parameters are handled using the Apache Commons CommandLineParser class, which makes sure that the passed parameters are available to the program. In order to make new functionalities available to the website, there also needs to be programmed an interface to the function, somewhere in the website. The next section details on that. Interfacing from the OpenML API \u00b6 By design, the REST API is not allowed to communicate with the Java App. All interfaces with the Java webapplication should go through other controllers of the PHP CodeIgniter framework., for example api_splits. Currently, the website features two main API's. These are represented by a Controller. Controllers can be found in the folder openml_OS/controllers.

For this purpose, a job scheduler has been implemented. OpenML maintains a list of (setup,task) tuples, that users requested to run. A setup is a flow with information about all parameter settings. Flows can be linked to a specific workbench. For example, the flows weka.J48(1) (which has id 60) and weka.SMO_PolyKernel(1) (which has id 70) are linked to Weka_3.7.10. When the same algorithm is uploaded from out another Weka version, a new version of the implementation is registered at OpenML. For example, if we would upload weka.J48 from the old version weka_3.7.5, OpenML would register the implementation as weka.J48(2). (In fact, this is what actually happend. See implementation id 100.) In order to schedule jobs, go to the job scheduler ( Alpha version , no guarantees). Select a task type, and give the experiment a name. It is important to filter the tasks and setups using the menu on the left, since the overview can be huge. Note that there are a some tasks on \"big datasets\", which can slow down the experimentation proces. Be considerate including those. Also make sure to filter on setups with flows of your own workbench version. If these are not in the system yet, register these on the share page . [OpenML Weka] The OpenML weka package can be used to automatically execute the scheduled jobs. Run it with the following command: java -cp openmlweka.jar org.openml.weka.experiment.RunJob -T 3 -N 1000 With T being the task type to execute, and N the number of runs you want to perform. (You can set this number as high as you like, the experimenter will stop as soon as there are no jobs left.) Note that this experimenter will only execute jobs that are of this Weka version. The OpenML Weka package can automatically register implementations on OpenML. Using the GUI, execute an OpenML task with all the implementations that you want to be registered. Before running those, these will automatically be registered on OpenML.","title":"Job Scheduling"},{"location":"Local-Installation/","text":"Docker installation \u00b6 The easiest way to set up a local version of OpenML is to use Docker Compose following the instructions here (thanks to Rui Quintino!): https://github.com/openml/openml-docker-dev If you run into problems, please post an issue in the same github repo.

Uploading any other files will result in an error. Tasks \u00b6 Tasks are uploaded through the function post task . The following files are needed: description : An XML adhiring to the XSD schema . Uploading any other files will result in an error. The task file should contain several input fields.

The top level files bootstrap the app. index.js simply renders the top component, and App.js adds global state using the React Context API. This includes the current theme, user authentication, search keywords, and other user input. Routes.js loads the correct components based on the current route (URL). The list of possible routes is defined in routes/index.js . There are two top level layouts: Main loads the main layout with a Sidebar , Header , and a certain page. The specific pages are in the pages folder. The Clear.js layout has no headers or sidebars, it is used mainly for user login and registration. Finally, themes contains the overall theme styling for the entire website. Styling \u00b6 To keep a consistent style and minimize dependencies and complexity, we build on Material UI components and FontAwesome icons. Theming is defined in themes/index.js and loaded in as a context ( ThemeContext ) in App.js . More specific styling is always defined through styled components in the corresponding pages. Handling state \u00b6 There are different levels of state management: * Global state is handled via React's native Context API (we don't use Redux). Contexts are defined in the component tree where needed (usually higher up) by a context provider component, and is accessed lower in the component tree by a context consumer. For instance, see the ThemeContext.Provider in App.js and the ThemeContext.Consumer in Sidebar.js . * Lower level components can pass state to their child components via props. * Local state changes should, when possible, be defined by React Hooks. Lifecycle Methods \u00b6 These are the React lifecycle methods and how we use them. When a component mounts, methods 1,2,4,7 will be called. When it updates, methods 2-6 will be called. constructor(): Set the initial state of the components getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state): Static method, only for changing the local state based on props. It returns the new state. shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState): Decides whether a state change requires a re-rendering or not. Used to optimize performance. render(): Returns the JSX to be rendered. It should NOT change the state. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps,prevState): Used to save 'old' DOM information right before an update. Returns a 'snapshot'. componentDidUpdate(prevProps,prevState,snapshot): For async requests or other operations right after component update. componentDidMount(): For async requests (e.g. API calls) right after the component mounted. componentWillUnMount(): Cleanup before the component is destroyed. componentDidCatch(error,info): For updating the state after an error is thrown. Forms and Events \u00b6 React wraps native browser events into synthetic events to handle interactions in a cross-browser compatible way. After being wrapped, they are sent to all event handlers, usually defined as callbacks. Note: for performance reasons, synthetic events are pooled and reused, so their properties are nullified after being consumed. If you want to use them asynchronously, you need to call event.persist() . HTML forms are different than other DOM elements because they keep their own state in plain HTML. To make sure that we can control the state we need to set the input field's value to a component state value. Here's an example of using an input field to change the title displayed in the component. const titles : { mainTitle : 'OpenML' }; class App extends Component { this . state = { titles }; // Receive synthetic event onTitleChange = ( event ) => { this . setState ({ titles . mainTitle : event . target . value }); } render (){ return ( < div classname = \"App\" > < h1 > { this . state . titles . mainTitle } < /h1> < form > < input type = \"text\" value = { this . state . titles . mainTitle } // control state onChange = { this . onTitleChange } // event handler callback /> < /form> < /div> ); } }","title":"React frontend"},{"location":"React/#react-app","text":"","title":"React App"},{"location":"React/#app-structure","text":"The structure of the source code looks as follows App.js index.js components |-- Sidebar.js |-- Header.js |-- ... layouts |-- Clear.js |-- Main.js pages |-- auth |-- cover |-- docs |-- search routes |-- index.js |-- Routes.js themes The website is designed as a single-page application.

URL Anatomy \u00b6 By default, CodeIgniter (and OpenML) accepts a URL in the following form: http://www.openml.org/index.php/<controller>/<function>/<p1>/<pN>/<free> The various parts in the URL are divided by slashes. Every URL starts with the protocol and server name (in the case of OpenML this is http://www.openml.org/ ). This is followed by the bootstrap file, which is always the same, i.e., index.php . The next part indicates the controller that needs to be invoked; typically this is frontend , rest_api or data , but it can be any file from the openml_OS folder controllers . Note that the suffix .php should not be included in the URL. The next part indicates which function of the controller should be invoked. This should be a existing, public function from the controller that is indicated in the controller part. These functions might have one or more parameters that need to be set. This is the following part of the URL (indicated by p1 and pN ). The parameters can be followed by anything in free format. Typically, this free format is used to pass on additional parameters in name - value format, or just a way of adding a human readable string to the URL for SEO purposes. For example, the following URL http://www.openml.org/index.php/frontend/page/home invokes the function page from the frontend controller and sets the only parameter of this function, $indicator , to value home . The function page loads the content of the specified folder ( $indicator ) into the main template. In this sense, the function page can be seen as some sort of specialized page loader. URL Shortening \u00b6 Since it is good practice to have URL\u2019s as short as possible, we have introduced some logic that shortens the URL\u2019s. Most importantly, the URL part that invokes index.php can be removed at no cost, since this file is always invoked. For this, we use Apache\u2019s rewrite engine. Rules for rewriting URL\u2019s can be found in the .htaccess file, but is suffices to say that any URL in the following format http://www.openml.org/index.php/<controller>/<function>/<params> can due to the rewrite engine also be requested with http://www.openml.org/<controller>/<function>/<params> Furthermore, since most of the pages are invoked by the function page of the frontend controller (hence, they come with the suffix frontend/page/page_name ) we also created a mapping that maps URL\u2019s in the following form http://www.openml.org/<page_name> to http://www.openml.org/frontend/page/<page_name> Note that Apache\u2019s rewrite engine will also add index.php to this. The exact mapping can be found in routes.php config file. Additional Mappings \u00b6 Additionally, a mapping is created from the following type of URL: http://www.openml.org/api/<any_query_string> to http://www.openml.org/rest_api/<any_query_string> This was done for backwards compatibility. Many plugins make calls to the not-existing api controller, which are automatically redirected to the rest_api controller. Exceptions \u00b6 It is important to note that not all pages do have a specific page folder. The page folders are a good way of structuring complex GUI\u2019s that need to be presented to the user, but in cases where the internal state changes are more important than the GUI\u2019s, it might be preferable to make the controller function print the output directly.

Root directory \u00b6 The root directory of OpenML contains the following files and folders. system : This folder contains all files provided by CodeIgniter 2.1.3. The contents of this folder is beyond the scope of this document, and not relevant for extending OpenML. All the files in this folder are in the same state as they were provided by Ellislabs, and none of these files should ever be changed. sparks : Sparks is a package management system for Codeigniter that allows for instant installation of libraries into the application. This folder contains two libraries provided by third party software developers, oauth1 (based on version 1 the oauth protocol) and oauth2 (similarly, based on version 2 of the oauth protocol). The exact contents of this folder is beyond the scope of this document and not relevant for extending OpenML. openml_OS : All files in this folder are written specifically for OpenML. When extending the functionality OpenML, usually one of the files in this folder needs to be adjusted. As a thorough understanding of the contents of this folder is vital for extending OpenML, we will discuss the contents of this folder in [[URL Mapping]] in more detail. index.php : This is the \u201cbootstrap\u201d file of the system. Basically, every page request on OpenML goes through this file (with the css, images and javascript files as only exception). It then determines which CodeIgniter and OpenML files need to be included. This file should not be edited. .htaccess : This file (which configures the Apache Rewrite Engine) makes sure that all URL requests will be directed to index.php . Without this file, we would need to include index.php explicitly in every URL request. This file makes sure that all other URL requests without index.php embedded in it automatically will be transformed to index.php . Eg., http://www.openml.org/frontend/page/home will be rewritten to http://www.openml.org/index.php/frontend/page/home . This will be explained in detail in [[URL Mapping]]. css : A folder containing all stylesheets. These are important for the layout of OpenML. data : A folder containing data files, e.g., datasets, implementation files, uploaded content. Please note that this folder does not necessarily needs to be present in the root directory. The OpenML Base Config file determines the exact location of this folder. downloads : Another data folder, containing files like the most recent database snapshot. img : A folder containing all static images shown on the webpage. js : A folder containing all used Javascript files and libraries, including third party libraries like jQuery and datatables. Various other files, like .gitignore, favicon.ico, etc. openml_OS \u00b6 This folder is (in CodeIgniter jargon) the \u201cApplication folder\u201d, and contains all files relevant to OpenML. Within this folder, the following folders should be present: (And also some other folders, but these are not used by OpenML) config : A folder containing all config files. Most notably, it contains the file BASE_CONFIG.php , in which all system specific variables are set; the config items within this file differs over various installations (e.g., on localhost, openml.org ). Most other config files, like database.php , will receive their values from BASE_CONFIG.php . Other important config files are autoload.php , determining which CodeIgniter / OpenML files will be loaded on any request, openML.php , containing config items specific to OpenML, and routes.php , which will be explained in [[URL Mapping]]. controllers : In the Model/View/Controller design pattern, all user interaction goes through controllers. In a webapplication setting this means that every time a URL gets requested, exactly one controller gets invoked. The exact dynamics of this will be explained in [[URL Mapping]]. core : A folder that contains CodeIgniter specific files. These are not relevant for the understanding of OpenML. helpers : This folder contains many convenience functions. Wikipedia states: \u201cA convenience function is a non-essential subroutine in a programming library or framework which is intended to ease commonly performed tasks\u201d. For example the file_upload_helper.php contains many functions that assist with uploading of files. Please note that a helper function must be explicitly loaded in either the autoload config or the files that uses its functions. libraries : Similar to sparks, this folder contains libraries specifically written for CodeIgniter. For example, the library used for all user management routines is in this folder. models : In the Model/View/Controller design pattern, models represent the state of the system. In a webapplication setting, you could say that a model is the link to the database. In OpenML, almost all tables of the database are represented by a model. Each model has general functionality applicable to all models (e.g., retrieve all records, retrieve record with constraints, insert record) and functionality specific to that model (e.g., retrieve a dataset that has certain data properties). Most models extend an (abstract) base class, located in the abstract folder. This way, all general functionality is programmed and maintained in one place. third_party : Although the name might suggests differently, this folder contains all OpenML Java libraries. views : In the Model/View/Controller design pattern, the views are the way information is presented on the screen. In a webapplication setting, a view usually is a block of (PHP generated) HTML code. The most notable view is frontend_main.php , which is the template file determining the main look and feel of OpenML. Every single page also has its own specific view (which is parsed within frontend_main.php ). These pages can be found (categorized by controller and name) in the pages folder. More about this structure is explained in [[URL Mapping]]. Frontend \u00b6 Architecture and libraries involved in generating the frontend functions. Code \u00b6 https://github.com/openml/website/tree/master/openml_OS/views High-level \u00b6 All pages are generated by first loading frontend_main.php . This creates the 'shell' in which the content is loaded. It loads all css and javascript libraries, and contains the html for displaying headers and footers. Create new page \u00b6 The preferred method is creating a new folder into the folder <root_directory>/openml_OS/views/pages/frontend This page can be requested by http://www.openml.org/frontend/page/<folder_name> or just http://www.openml.org/<folder_name> This method is preferred for human readable webpages, where the internal actions are simple, and the output is complex. We will describe the files that can be in this folder. pre.php : Mandatory file. Will be executed first. Do not make this file produce any output! Can be used to pre-render data, or set some variables that are used in other files. body.php : Highly recommended file. Intended for displaying the main content of this file. Will be rendered at the right location within the template file ( frontend_main.php ). javascript.php : Non-mandatory file. Intended for javascript function on which body.php relies. Will be rendered within a javascript block in the header of the page. post.php : Non mandatory file. Will only be executed when a POST request is done (e.g., when a HTML form was send using the POST protocol). Will be executed after pre.php , but before the rendering process (and thus, before body.php and javascript.php ). Should handle the posted input, e.g., file uploads. It is also recommended to add the newly created folder to the mapping in the routes.php config file. This way it can also be requested by the shortened version of the URL.

Because the system is still experimental and very much in development, the details are subject to change. Below, the score system is described in more detailed followed by our rationale for this system for those interested. If anything is unclear or you have any feedback of the system do not hesitate to let us know. The scores \u00b6 All scores are awarded to users and involve datasets, flows, tasks and runs, or knowledge pieces in short. Activity Activity score is awarded to users for contributing to the knowledge base of OpenML. This includes uploading knowledge pieces, leaving likes and downloading new knowledge pieces. Uploads are rewarded strongest, with 3 activity, followed by likes, with 2 activity, and downloads are rewarded the least, with 1 activity. Reach Reach score is awarded to knowledge pieces and by extension their uploaders for the expressed interest of other users. It is increased by 2 for every user that leaves a like on a knowledge piece and increased by 1 for every user that downloads it for the first time. Impact Impact score is awarded to knowledge pieces and by extension their uploaders for the reuse of these knowledge pieces. A dataset is reused if when it is used as input in a task while flows and tasks are reused in runs. 1 Impact is awarded for every reuse by a user that is not the uploader. Impact of a reused knowledge piece is further increased by half of the acquired reach and half of the acquired impact of a reuse, usually rounded down. So the impact of a dataset that is used in a single task with reach 10 and impact 5, is 8 (\u230a1+0.5*10+0.5*5 \u230b). The rationale \u00b6 One of OpenML's core ideas is to create an open science environment for sharing and exploration of knowledge while getting credit for your work. The activity score serves the encouragement of sharing and exploration. Reach makes exploration easier (by finding well liked, and/or often downloaded knowledge pieces), while also providing a form of credit to the user. Impact is another form of credit that is closer in concept to citation scores. Where to find it \u00b6 The number of likes and downloads as well as the reach and impact of knowledge pieces can be found on the top of their respective pages, for example the Iris data set . In the top right you will also find the new Like button next to the already familiar download button. When searching for knowledge pieces on the search page , you will now be able to see the statistics mentioned above as well. In addition you can sort the search results on their downloads, likes, reach or impact. On user profiles you will find all statistics relevant to that user, as well as graphs of their progress on the three scores. Badges \u00b6 Badges are intended to provide discrete goals for users to aim for. They are only in a conceptual phase, depending on the community's reaction they will be further developed. The badges a user has acquired can be found on their user profile below the score graphs. The currently implemented badges are: Clockwork Scientist For being active every day for a period of time. Team Player For collaborating with other users; reusing a knowledge piece of someone who has reused a knowledge piece of yours. Good News Everyone For achieving a high reach on singular knowledge piece you uploaded. Downvotes \u00b6 Although not part of the scores, downvotes have also been introduced. They are intended to indicate a flaw of a data set, flow, task or run that can be fixed, for example a missing description. If you want to indicate something is wrong with a knowledge piece, click the number of issues statistic at the top the page. A panel will open where you either agree with an already raised issue anonymously or submit your own issue (not anonymously). You can also sort search results by the number of downvotes, or issues on the search page . Opting out \u00b6 If you really do not like the altmetrics you can opt-out by changing the setting on your profile.

OpenML aims to facilitate the creation of curated, comprehensive suites of machine learning tasks, covering precise sets of conditions. Seamlessly integrated into the OpenML platform, benchmark suites standardize the setup, execution, analysis, and reporting of benchmarks. Moreover, they make benchmarking a whole lot easier: - all datasets are uniformly formatted in standardized data formats - they can be easily downloaded programmatically through APIs and client libraries - they come with machine-readable meta-information , such as the occurrence of missing values, to train algorithms correctly - standardized train-test splits are provided to ensure that results can be objectively compared - results can be shared in a reproducible way through the APIs - results from other users can be easily downloaded and reused Software interfaces \u00b6 To use OpenML Benchmark suites, you can use bindings in several programming languages. These all interface with the OpenML REST API. The default endpoint for this is https://www.openml.org/api/v1/ , but this can change when later versions of the API are released. To use the code examples below, you only need a recent version of one of the following libraries: OpenML Java ApiConnector (version 1.0.22 and up). OpenML Weka (version 0.9.6 and up). This package adds a Weka Integration. OpenML Python (version 0.9.0 and up) OpenML R (version 1.8 and up) Using OpenML Benchmark Suites \u00b6 Below are walk-through instructions for common use cases, as well as code examples. These illustrations use the reference OpenML-CC18 benchmark suite, but you can replace it with any other benchmark suite. Note that a benchmark suite is a set of OpenML tasks , which envelop not only a specific dataset, but also the train-test splits and (for predictive tasks) the target feature. Terminology and current status Benchmark suites are sets of OpenML tasks that you can create and manage yourself. At the same time, it is often useful to also share the set of experiments (runs) with the ensuing benchmarking results. For legacy reasons, such sets of tasks or runs are called studies in the OpenML REST API. In the OpenML bindings (Python, R, Java,...) these are called either sets or studies . When benchmarking, you will probably use two types of sets: Sets of tasks. These can be created, edited, downloaded or deleted via the OpenML API. Website forms will be added soon. Also the set of underlying datasets can be easily retrieved via the API. Sets of runs. Likewise, these can be created, edited, downloaded or deleted via the OpenML API. On the website, these are currently simply called 'studies'. Also the set of underlying tasks, datasets and flows can be easily retrieved. It is possible to link a set of runs to a benchmark study, aimed to collect future runs on that specific set of tasks. Additional information on these will be provided in a separate page. Listing the benchmark suites \u00b6 The current list of benchmark suites is explicitly listed on the bottom of this page. The list of all sets of tasks can also be fetched programmatically. This list includes the suite's ID (and optionally an alias), which can be used to fetch further details.

First, the list of tasks is downloaded as already illustrated above. Next, a specific algorithm (or pipeline) can be run on each of them. The OpenML API will automatically evaluate the algorithm using the pre-set train-test splits and store the predictions and scores in a run object. This run object can then be immediately published, pushing the results to the OpenML server, so that they can be compared against all others on the same benchmark set.

A Jupyter Notebook that shows how to pull in the latest state-of-the-art results for any of the benchmark suites A Jupyter Notebook that does a detailed analysis of all results in a benchmark suite, and an example run on the OpenML-CC18.

We very much welcome new scripts and notebooks, or improvements to the existing ones, that help others to create benchmark suites and analyse benchmarking results. List of benchmarking suites \u00b6 OpenML-CC18 \u00b6 The OpenML-CC18 suite contains all OpenML datasets from mid-2018 that satisfy a large set of clear requirements for thorough yet practical benchmarking. It includes datasets frequently used in benchmarks published over the last years, so it can be used as a drop-in replacement for many benchmarking setups. List of datasets and properties The suite is defined as the set of all verified OpenML datasets that satisfy the following requirements: the number of observations are between 500 and 100000 to focus on medium-sized datasets, that are not too small and not too big, the number of features does not exceed 5000 features to keep the runtime of algorithms low, the target attribute has at least two classes have classes with less than 20 observations the ratio of the minority class and the majority class is above 0.05, to eliminate highly imbalanced datasets which require special treatment for both algorithms and evaluation measures. We excluded datasets which: are artificially generated (not to confuse with simulated) cannot be randomized via a 10-fold cross-validation due to grouped samples or because they are time series or data streams are a subset of a larger dataset have no source or reference available can be perfectly classified by a single attribute or a decision stump allow a decision tree to achieve 100% accuracy on a 10-fold cross-validation task have more than 5000 features after one-hot-encoding categorical features are created by binarization of regression tasks or multiclass classification tasks, or are sparse data (e.g., text mining data sets) Detailed motivation of these decisions We chose the CC18 datasets to allow for practical benchmarking based on the characteristics that might be problematic based on our experience, and to avoid common pitfalls that may invalidate benchmark studies: We used at least 500 data points to allow performing cross-validation while still having a large-enough test split. We limited the datasets to 100.000 data points to allow the algorithms to train machine learning models in a reasonable amount of time. We limited the number of features to 5000 to allow the usage of algorithms which scale unfavourably in the number of features. This limitation, together with the two limitations above aims to allow running all \u201cstandard\u201d machine learning algorithms (naive bayes, linear models, support vector machines, tree-based ensemble methods and neural networks) on the benchmark suite. We required each dataset to have at least two classes to be able to work in a supervised classification setting. We require each class to have at least 20 observations to be able to perform stratified cross-validation where there is at least one observation from each class in each split. We have found that not having all classes present in all training and test sets can make several machine learning packages fail. We require a certain balancedness (ratio of minority class to majority class) to prevent cases where only predicting the majority class would be beneficial. This is most likely the restriction which is most debatable, but we found it very helpful to apply a large set of machine learning algorithms across several libraries to the study. We expect that future studies focus more on imbalanced datasets. Furthermore, we aimed to have the dataset collection as general as possible, rule out as few algorithms as possible and have it usable as easily as possible: We strived to remove artificial datasets as they, for example, come from textbooks and it is hard to reliably assess their difficulty. We admit that there is a blurred line between artificial and simulated datasets and do not have a perfect distinction between them (for example, a lot of phenomena can be simulated, but the outcome might be like a simple, artificial dataset). Therefore, we removed datasets if we were in doubt of whether they are simulated or artificial. We removed datasets which require grouped sampling because they are time series or data streams which should be treated with special care by machine learning algorithms (i.e., taking the time aspect into account). To be on the safe side, we also removed datasets where each sample constitutes a single data stream. We removed datasets which are a subset of larger datasets. Allowing subsets would be very subjective as there is no objective choice of a dataset subset size or a subset of the variables or classes. Therefore, creating dataset subsets would open a Pandora\u2019s Box. We removed datasets which have no source or reference available to potentially learn more about these datasets if we observe unexpected behavior in future studies. In contrast, we would not be able to learn more about the background of a dataset which has no description and publication attached, leaving us with a complete black box. We removed datasets which can be perfectly classified by a single attribute or a decision stump as they do not allow to meaningfully compare machine learning algorithms (they all achieve 100% accuracy unless the hyperparameters are set in a bogus way). We removed datasets where a decision tree could achieve 100% accuracy on a 10-fold cross-validation task to remove datasets which can be solved by a simple algorithm which is prone to overfitting training data. We found that this is a good indicator of too easy datasets. Obviously, other datasets will appear easy for several algorithms, and we aim to learn more about the characteristics of such datasets in future studies. We removed datasets which have more than 5000 features after one-hot-encoding categorical features. One-hot-encoding is the most frequent way to deal with categorical variables across the different machine learning libraries MLR, scikit-learn and WEKA. In order to limit the number of features to 5000 as explained above, we imposed the additional constraint that this should be counted after one-hot-encoding to allow wide applicability of the benchmark suite. We removed datasets which were created by binarization of regression tasks or multiclass classification task for similar reasons as for forbidding dataset subsets. We did not include sparse datasets because not all machine learning libraries (i.e., all machine learning models) can handle them gracefully, which is in contrast to our goal which is wide applicability. OpenML100 \u00b6 The OpenML100 was a predecessor of the OpenML-CC18, consisting of 100 classification datasets . We recommend that you use the OpenML-CC18 instead, because the OpenML100 suffers from some teething issues in the design of benchmark suites. For instance, it contains several datasets that are too easy to model with today's machine learning algorithms, as well as datasets that represent time series analysis problems. These do not invalidate benchmarks run on the OpenML100, but may obfuscate the interpretation of results. The 'OpenML-CC18' handle is also more descriptive and allows easier versioning. The OpenML100 was first published in the Arxiv preprint OpenML Benchmarking Suites and the OpenML100 . List of datasets and properties For reference, the OpenML100 included datasets satisfying the following requirements: the number of observations are between 500 and 100000 to focus on medium-sized datasets, that are not too small for proper training and not too big for practical experimentation the number of features does not exceed 5000 features to keep the runtime of algorithms low the target attribute has at least two classes he ratio of the minority class and the majority class is above 0.05 to eliminate highly imbalanced datasets that would obfuscate a clear analysis It excluded datasets which: cannot be randomized via a 10-fold cross-validation due to grouped samples have an unknown origin or no clearly defined task are variants of other datasets (e.g. binarized regression tasks) include sparse data (e.g., text mining data sets) Need help? \u00b6 We are happy to answer to any suggestion or question you may have.

These illustrations use the reference OpenML-CC18 benchmark suite, but you can replace it with any other benchmark suite. Note that a benchmark suite is a set of OpenML tasks , which envelop not only a specific dataset, but also the train-test splits and (for predictive tasks) the target feature. Terminology and current status Benchmark suites are sets of OpenML tasks that you can create and manage yourself. At the same time, it is often useful to also share the set of experiments (runs) with the ensuing benchmarking results. For legacy reasons, such sets of tasks or runs are called studies in the OpenML REST API. In the OpenML bindings (Python, R, Java,...) these are called either sets or studies . When benchmarking, you will probably use two types of sets: Sets of tasks. These can be created, edited, downloaded or deleted via the OpenML API. Website forms will be added soon. Also the set of underlying datasets can be easily retrieved via the API. Sets of runs. Likewise, these can be created, edited, downloaded or deleted via the OpenML API. On the website, these are currently simply called 'studies'. Also the set of underlying tasks, datasets and flows can be easily retrieved. It is possible to link a set of runs to a benchmark study, aimed to collect future runs on that specific set of tasks.

It includes datasets frequently used in benchmarks published over the last years, so it can be used as a drop-in replacement for many benchmarking setups. List of datasets and properties The suite is defined as the set of all verified OpenML datasets that satisfy the following requirements: the number of observations are between 500 and 100000 to focus on medium-sized datasets, that are not too small and not too big, the number of features does not exceed 5000 features to keep the runtime of algorithms low, the target attribute has at least two classes have classes with less than 20 observations the ratio of the minority class and the majority class is above 0.05, to eliminate highly imbalanced datasets which require special treatment for both algorithms and evaluation measures. We excluded datasets which: are artificially generated (not to confuse with simulated) cannot be randomized via a 10-fold cross-validation due to grouped samples or because they are time series or data streams are a subset of a larger dataset have no source or reference available can be perfectly classified by a single attribute or a decision stump allow a decision tree to achieve 100% accuracy on a 10-fold cross-validation task have more than 5000 features after one-hot-encoding categorical features are created by binarization of regression tasks or multiclass classification tasks, or are sparse data (e.g., text mining data sets) Detailed motivation of these decisions We chose the CC18 datasets to allow for practical benchmarking based on the characteristics that might be problematic based on our experience, and to avoid common pitfalls that may invalidate benchmark studies: We used at least 500 data points to allow performing cross-validation while still having a large-enough test split. We limited the datasets to 100.000 data points to allow the algorithms to train machine learning models in a reasonable amount of time. We limited the number of features to 5000 to allow the usage of algorithms which scale unfavourably in the number of features. This limitation, together with the two limitations above aims to allow running all \u201cstandard\u201d machine learning algorithms (naive bayes, linear models, support vector machines, tree-based ensemble methods and neural networks) on the benchmark suite. We required each dataset to have at least two classes to be able to work in a supervised classification setting. We require each class to have at least 20 observations to be able to perform stratified cross-validation where there is at least one observation from each class in each split. We have found that not having all classes present in all training and test sets can make several machine learning packages fail. We require a certain balancedness (ratio of minority class to majority class) to prevent cases where only predicting the majority class would be beneficial. This is most likely the restriction which is most debatable, but we found it very helpful to apply a large set of machine learning algorithms across several libraries to the study. We expect that future studies focus more on imbalanced datasets. Furthermore, we aimed to have the dataset collection as general as possible, rule out as few algorithms as possible and have it usable as easily as possible: We strived to remove artificial datasets as they, for example, come from textbooks and it is hard to reliably assess their difficulty. We admit that there is a blurred line between artificial and simulated datasets and do not have a perfect distinction between them (for example, a lot of phenomena can be simulated, but the outcome might be like a simple, artificial dataset). Therefore, we removed datasets if we were in doubt of whether they are simulated or artificial. We removed datasets which require grouped sampling because they are time series or data streams which should be treated with special care by machine learning algorithms (i.e., taking the time aspect into account). To be on the safe side, we also removed datasets where each sample constitutes a single data stream. We removed datasets which are a subset of larger datasets. Allowing subsets would be very subjective as there is no objective choice of a dataset subset size or a subset of the variables or classes. Therefore, creating dataset subsets would open a Pandora\u2019s Box. We removed datasets which have no source or reference available to potentially learn more about these datasets if we observe unexpected behavior in future studies. In contrast, we would not be able to learn more about the background of a dataset which has no description and publication attached, leaving us with a complete black box. We removed datasets which can be perfectly classified by a single attribute or a decision stump as they do not allow to meaningfully compare machine learning algorithms (they all achieve 100% accuracy unless the hyperparameters are set in a bogus way). We removed datasets where a decision tree could achieve 100% accuracy on a 10-fold cross-validation task to remove datasets which can be solved by a simple algorithm which is prone to overfitting training data. We found that this is a good indicator of too easy datasets. Obviously, other datasets will appear easy for several algorithms, and we aim to learn more about the characteristics of such datasets in future studies. We removed datasets which have more than 5000 features after one-hot-encoding categorical features. One-hot-encoding is the most frequent way to deal with categorical variables across the different machine learning libraries MLR, scikit-learn and WEKA. In order to limit the number of features to 5000 as explained above, we imposed the additional constraint that this should be counted after one-hot-encoding to allow wide applicability of the benchmark suite. We removed datasets which were created by binarization of regression tasks or multiclass classification task for similar reasons as for forbidding dataset subsets. We did not include sparse datasets because not all machine learning libraries (i.e., all machine learning models) can handle them gracefully, which is in contrast to our goal which is wide applicability.","title":"OpenML-CC18"},{"location":"benchmark/#openml100","text":"The OpenML100 was a predecessor of the OpenML-CC18, consisting of 100 classification datasets .
