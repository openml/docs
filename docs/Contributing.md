OpenML is an open source project, <a href="https://github.com/openml">hosted on GitHub</a>. We welcome everybody to help improve OpenML, and make it more useful for everyone.

We want to make machine learning and data analysis **simple**, **accessible**, **collaborative** and **open** with an optimal **division of labour** between computers and humans.

## Want to get involved?

Awesome, we're happy to have you! :tada:

OpenML is dependent on the community. If you want to help, please email us (openmlHQ@googlegroups.com). If you feel already comfortable you can help by opening issues or make a pull request on GitHub. We also have regular workshops you can join (they are announced on openml.org).

### Who are we?

We are a group of friendly people who are excited about open science and machine learning. A list of people currently involved can be found [here](https://www.openml.org/contact).

### We need help!

We are currently looking for help with:

- User feedback (best via GitHub issues, but email is also fine)
- Frontend / UX / Design of the website
- Backend / API
- Outreach / making OpenML better known (especially in non-ML-communities, where people have data but no analysis experise)
- Helping with the interfaces ([Python](Python-start), [WEKA](https://www.openml.org/#WEKA), [MOA](https://www.openml.org/#plugin_moa), [RapidMiner](https://www.openml.org/#plugin_rm), [Java](Java-guide), [R](R-guide); find the links to GitHub repos [here](https://github.com/openml/OpenML/wiki))
- Helping with documenting the interfaces or the API
- What could we do better to get new users started? Help us to figure out what is difficult to understand about OpenML. If you _are_ a new user, you are the perfect person for this!
