OpenML is an open source project, <a href="https://github.com/openml">hosted on GitHub</a>. We welcome everybody to help improve OpenML, and make it more useful for everyone.

!!! tip "Mission"
    We want to make machine learning **open** and **accessible** for the benefit of all of humanity.
    OpenML offers an **entirely open online platform** for machine learning datasets, models, and experiments,
    making them **easy to use and share** to facilitate global collaboration and extensive automation.

## Want to get involved?

Awesome, we're happy to have you! :tada:

### Who are we?

We are a group of friendly people who are excited about open science and machine learning. 

[Read more about who we are, what we stand for, and how to get in touch](https://www.openml.org/about).

### We need help!

We are currently looking for help with:

:octicons-comment-discussion-16: User feedback (best via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/openml), but email or Slack is also fine)

- Frontend / UX / Design of the website
- Backend / API
- Outreach / making OpenML better known (especially in non-ML-communities, where people have data but no analysis experise)
- Helping with the interfaces (Python,R,Julia,Java) and tool integrations
- Helping with documenting the interfaces or the API
- What could we do better to get new users started? Help us to figure out what is difficult to understand about OpenML. If you _are_ a new user, you are the perfect person for this!

### Beginner issues
