## Installation
The OpenML website runs on [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Dash](https://dash.plot.ly/). You need to install these first.

* Download or clone the source code for the OpenML website from [GitHub](https://github.com/openml/openml.org).
Then, go into that folder (it should have the `requirements.txt` and `package.json` files).
``` python
git clone https://github.com/openml/openml.org.git
cd openml.org
```

* Install Flask, Dash, and dependencies using [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
``` python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Install React and dependencies using [NPM (8 or higher)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
``` python
cd server/src/client/app/
npm install
```

## Building and running

Go back to the home directory. Build a production version of the website with:

``` python
npm run build --prefix server/src/client/app/
```

Start the server by running:

``` python
flask run
```

You should now see the app running in your browser at `localhost:5000`

Note: If you run the app using HTTPS, add the SSL context or use 'adhoc' to use on-the-fly certificates or you can specify your own certificates.

``` python
flask run --cert='adhoc'
```

As flask server is not suitable for production we recommend you to use some other server if you want to deploy
your openml installation in production. We currently use gunicorn for production server. You can install the gunicorn server and run it:
```
gunicorn --certfile cert.pem --keyfile key.pem -b localhost:5000 autoapp:app
``` 

## Development

To start the React frontend in developer mode, go to `server/src/client/app` and run:

``` python
npm run start
```

The app should automatically open at `localhost:3000` and any changes made to
the code will automatically reload the website (hot loading).

For the new Next.js frontend, install and run like this:
``` python
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Structure
<img src="../img/structure.png" alt="OpenML Website structure" width="500"/>

The website is built on the following components:  

* A [Flask backend](Flask.md). Written in Python, the backend takes care of all communication with the OpenML server. It builds on top of the OpenML Python API. It also takes care of user authentication and keeps the search engine (ElasticSearch) up to date with the latest information from the server. Files are located in the `server` folder.
* A [React frontend](React.md). Written in JavaScript, this takes care of rendering the website. It pulls in information from the search engine, and shows plots rendered by Dash. It also contains forms (e.g. for logging in or uploading new datasets), which will be sent off to the backend for processing. Files are located in `server/src/client/app`.
* [Dash dashboards](Dash.md). Written in Python, Dash is used for writing interactive plots. It pulls in data from the Python API, and renders the plots as React components. Files are located in `server/src/dashboard`.
