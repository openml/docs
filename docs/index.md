## How to use OpenML

OpenML is accessible to a wide range of people:  

:computer: <a href="https://www.openml.org" target='blank_'>Explore the OpenML website</a> to discover, download and upload ML resources.

:robot: [Install an OpenML library](intro/index.md) to access and share resources programmatically through our APIs. Select one of the detailed guides in the top menu.

:mortar_board: [Get started](./concepts/index.md) by learning more about the structure and concepts behind OpenML, such as Datasets, Tasks, Flows, Runs, Benchmarking and much more. This will help you leverage OpenML even better in your work.

## Contributing to OpenML

OpenML is an open source project, <a href="https://github.com/openml">hosted on GitHub</a>. We welcome everybody to help improve OpenML, and make it more useful for everyone. For more information on how to contribute, see the [Contributing](./contributing/index.md) page.

We want to make machine learning and data analysis **simple**, **accessible**, **collaborative** and **open** with an optimal **division of labour** between computers and humans.

## Want to get involved?

Awesome, we're happy to have you! :tada:

OpenML is dependent on the community. If you want to help, please email us (openmlHQ@googlegroups.com). If you feel already comfortable you can help by opening issues or make a pull request on GitHub. We also have regular workshops you can join (they are announced on openml.org).
