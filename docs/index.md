You might also need to set up the API key. For more information, see [Authentication](http://localhost:8000/concepts/openness/).

## Learning OpenML

Aside from the individual package documentations, you can learn more about OpenML through the following resources:<br>
The core concepts of OpenML are explained in the [Concepts](./concepts/index.md) page. These concepts include the principle behind using Datasets, Runs, Tasks, Flows, Benchmarking and much more. Going through them will help you leverage OpenML even better in your work.<br>

## Contributing to OpenML

OpenML is an open source project, <a href="https://github.com/openml">hosted on GitHub</a>. We welcome everybody to help improve OpenML, and make it more useful for everyone. For more information on how to contribute, see the [Contributing](./contributing/index.md) page.

We want to make machine learning and data analysis **simple**, **accessible**, **collaborative** and **open** with an optimal **division of labour** between computers and humans.

## Want to get involved?

Awesome, we're happy to have you! :tada:

OpenML is dependent on the community. If you want to help, please email us (openmlHQ@googlegroups.com). If you feel already comfortable you can help by opening issues or make a pull request on GitHub. We also have regular workshops you can join (they are announced on openml.org).
